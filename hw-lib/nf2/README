NetFPGA-10G Hardware Table
----------------------------------------

This library creates and maintains a single software table that contains all
the flows that are currently held in the NetFPGA card. The card itself splits
exact match flows into BRAM(currently) and wildcard match flows into TCAMs.
Currently there are 24 usable wildcard flow entries and 1,024 available exact match
entries. The exact match table is hashed so actual available entries will
vary.

Installation
----------------------------------------

First build OpenFlow ensuring you include the directive to build the
openflow_netfpga hardware table in your configure statement:

	% ./configure --enable-hw-lib=nf2

For further help regarding building OpenFlow please see the INSTALL file in
the OpenFlow root directory.

Platform support
----------------

OpenFlow v1.0 with NetFPGA-10G hardware table has been tested on Fedora14
which is the officially supported platform of NetFPGA-10G.

Running
----------------------------------------

<<The bitfile download description is borrowed from NetFPGA-1G.
  The following download script will be released in the future>>

Use nf2_download to download the openflow_switch.bit file that is located in
the <openflow>/datapath/hwtable_nf2 folder:

	% nf_download -r <openflow>/hw-lib/nf2/openflow_switch.bit

'-r' option enables PHY interrupt for its link status changing, and OpenFlow
switch can detect it.

Run ofdatapth with indicating *all* the NetFPGA interfaces:

	% ofdatapath punix:/var/run/test -i nf0,nf1,nf2,nf3

Run ofprotocol:

	% ofprotocol unix:/var/run/test tcp:(your controller address and port)

At this point your OpenFlow switch should be ready to go.
